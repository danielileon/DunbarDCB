# Dunbar (Discovering Communities in the Borderlands)

**Daniel I. Leon**

Welcome! For this project, I worked with the Arizona State Museum and with other student developers at the Center for Digital Humanities, to develop an informative AR experience at the [Dunbar Pavilion](https://thedunbartucson.org/), an African American arts and culture center.

The following QR code is available to the public at the Dunbar Pavilion, but can be scanned and experienced remotely. Try it below!
