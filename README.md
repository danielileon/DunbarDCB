# Dunbar (Discovering Communities in the Borderlands)

**Daniel I. Leon**

Welcome! For this project, I worked with the Arizona State Museum and with other student developers at the Center for Digital Humanities, to develop an informative AR experience at the [Dunbar Pavilion](https://thedunbartucson.org/), an African American arts and culture center.

We developed the project in 8th Wall and in BlippAR. The code files from 8th Wall are included in this repo. However, the media files provided by the Dunbar Pavilion and the Arizona State Museum have not. Instead, those are visible only within the AR experience.

The following QR code is available to the public at the Dunbar Pavilion, but can be scanned and experienced remotely. Try it below!
